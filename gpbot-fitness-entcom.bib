abstract="This article presents a modified version of the multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA II in order to find optimal opening strategies in the real-time strategy game StarCraft II. Based on an event-driven simulator capable of performing an accurate estimate of in-game build-times the quality of different build lists can be judged. These build lists are used as chromosomes within the genetic algorithm. Procedural constraints e.g. given by the Tech-Tree or other game mechanisms, are implicitly encoded into them. Typical goals are to find the build list producing most units of one or more certain types up to a certain time (Rush) or to produce one unit as early as possible (Tech-Push). Here, the number of entries in a build list varies and the objective values have in contrast to the search space a very small diversity. We introduce our game simulator including its graphical user interface, the modifications necessary to fit the genetic algorithm to our problem, test our algorithm on different Tech-Pushes and Rushes for all three races, and validate it with empirical data of expert StarCraft II players.",

We present experimental results in SparCraft — a StarCraft combat simulator --- using battle setups extracted from human and bot StarCraft games.  We show that our system is able to turn base assaults that are  losses for the defenders into wins, as well as reduce the number of surviving attackers. Performance is heavily dependent on the quality of the prediction of the attacker army composition used for training, and its similarity to the army used for evaluation. These results apply to both human and bot games.},

abstract = "Abstract This paper presents a procedural content generation (PCG) method that is able to generate aesthetic maps for a real-time strategy game. The maps were characterized based on either their geometrical properties or their topological measures (obtained in this latter case from the sphere-of-influence graph induced by each map). Using these features, a distance function between maps can be defined. This function is used in turn to determine how close/far each map generated by the \{PCG\} method (a self-adaptive evolutionary algorithm) is to a collection of maps which were taken initially to be aesthetic or non-aesthetic. This correspondence guided a multi-objective evolutionary approach whereby maps close to aesthetic maps and far to non-aesthetic maps are sought. Self-organizing maps are used to ascertain whether the so-generated maps naturally cluster together with aesthetic maps, as well as to provide a qualitative assessment of the ability of each set of features to characterize the latter.
